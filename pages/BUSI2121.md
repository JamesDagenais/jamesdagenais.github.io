### What is Organizational Behaviour

* The attitudes of individuals and groups in organizations
We spend 100000 hours plus at work..we want this time to be..not insufferable
* How can jobs be structured more effectively
* How contextual variables affect organizations

### Goals of Organizational Behaviour

* Predicting the Behaviour in Organizations (When)
How to predict the Behaviour of others is advantageous. When are people going to do diffrent things. (don't just guess how people will act)
* Explaining behaviour in Organizations (Why)
There is a big difference between predicting and knowing why something happens
    * why are certain people less motivated, satisfied etc.
    But..... it's tricky!!
        * Multiple Causes
        * Things can chage over time
* Managing Behaviour in Organizations (How)
Management = the art of getting things accomplished in organizations through others.
    * All about taking action (which comes from what we find out from 1&2)
    * The issue is a lot of times in the real world managers take action with out information from the first two steps

### Evidence - Based Management

* NOT one sized fits all analysis and Management

Most people aren't basing their management on current studies etc..

eg:     
    money isn't actually the best motivator

#### Good Evidence

* Scientific , peer review research
* Data generator for a specific organization
* Views of experts
* Crowdsourcing

### Why should we care?

* We are living in a 4th industrial revolution (automation)
Things are changing

* "It's human skills - not techincal skills are what are need..."

* Soft skills are increasingly more important than hard skills
* In the age of automation jobs will require **critical things and collaboration skills**
* These skills are in much higher demand
* Technical skills + communication , collaboration, leadership etc.

* A focus on developing these skills is necessary
This class is on the right track
* OB can help you cultivate your own skills. Which are critical in the real world to helping you get and keep jobs
* OB can help to make better leaders - be that you or your bosses
We have a change to be a leader in so many different parts of our lives
* OB can be used to make our workplaces better / safer/ more enjoyable and motivating
* OB can help organizational effectiveness and efficiency
If our organization is successful we will be too
