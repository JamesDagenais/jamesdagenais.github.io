### What is Organizational Behaviour

* The attitudes of individuals and groups in organizations
We spend 100000 hours plus at work..we want this time to be..not insufferable
* How can jobs be structured more effectively
* How contextual variables affect organizations

### Goals of Organizational Behaviour

* Predicting the Behaviour in Organizations (When)
How to predict the Behaviour of others is advantageous. When are people going to do diffrent things. (don't just guess how people will act)
* Explaining behaviour in Organizations (Why)
There is a big difference between predicting and knowing why something happens
    * why are certain people less motivated, satisfied etc.
    But..... it's tricky!!
        * Multiple Causes
        * Things can chage over time
* Managing Behaviour in Organizations (How)
Management = the art of getting things accomplished in organizations through others.
    * All about taking action (which comes from what we find out from 1&2)
    * The issue is a lot of times in the real world managers take action with out information from the first two steps

### Evidence - Based Management

* NOT one sized fits all analysis and Management

Most people aren't basing their management on current studies etc..

eg:     
    money isn't actually the best motivator

#### Good Evidence

* Scientific , peer review research
* Data generator for a specific organization
* Views of experts
* Crowdsourcing

### Why should we care?

* We are living in a 4th industrial revolution (automation)
Things are changing

* "It's human skills - not techincal skills are what are need..."

* Soft skills are increasingly more important than hard skills
* In the age of automation jobs will require **critical things and collaboration skills**
* These skills are in much higher demand
* Technical skills + communication , collaboration, leadership etc.

* A focus on developing these skills is necessary
This class is on the right track
* OB can help you cultivate your own skills. Which are critical in the real world to helping you get and keep jobs
* OB can help to make better leaders - be that you or your bosses
We have a change to be a leader in so many different parts of our lives
* OB can be used to make our workplaces better / safer/ more enjoyable and motivating
* OB can help organizational effectiveness and efficiency
If our organization is successful we will be too


### How much do you know about OB

* The most effective organizational leaders will possess a core set of persnoality traits.
Its about the whole package
* Nearly all workers prefer stimulating, challenging jobs.
Stimulating work is more fun!
People want to prove themselves
Comfort zone - some people don't want to step out of it
* Pay is the best way to motivate employees and improve job performance.
Money provides stability

**ALL OF THESE STATEMENTS ARE FALSE**

* The most effective organizational leaders will possess a core set of persnoality traits.
Vary a lot
* Nearly all workers prefer stimulating, challenging jobs.
Some people like routine jobs
* Pay is the best way to motivate employees and improve job performance.
Meaning of work can be a much better motivator

### What predicts behaviour?

Individual factors, Situational factors, Environmental factors

### The History of OB

People used to be looking for **THE** correct solution

#### Classical View

Context:

    Industrial revolution (late 1700s to late 1800s)
    Industry = work
    Revolution = rapid change

    Farms -> Factories
    etc..

    * Power!!! (sped up work)
    Helped Factories grow very quickly
    * Machinery upgrades
    * Transportation (trains, roads etc.)

This created a need for how to organize work

* The industrial Revolution - Issues
    * Increasing pace of industry (logistical questions)
    * People working alongside machinery (Training, safety)
    * Large groups working together (personality clashes, authority relationships - didn't really exist before)

* How are we gonig to organize this
* How are we going to maximize productivity

* Founding Fathers of OB

##### Max Weber - Big picture (Bureaucracy)

* Bureaucracy
    * Organizations should look like government
        * Strict chain of command
        * Rules and regulations
        * Centralization of power
    * Alternative to traditional, family based management
        * Concerned with favouritism or 'particularism'
        * Standard guidelines should determine peoples hiring / firing , positions
        Big picture thinker

##### Frederick Taylor - Micro (Scientific management)

More Micro focus

* Scientific management (Taylorism)
    * Applying science to work
    * The customized approach was inefficient (people just did what they though was good)
    * Wanted to find the "one right way" to do every single task (how many motions, goal what how you could speed things up, end goal was a formula for the 'right way')
    * Written instructions, standardization of *everything* (even how to do their lunch break!)

* Time and motion studies
    * Reduce amount of time
    * Reduce number of motions

    * Break each task into small steps
    * Standardize
    * Proscribe protocols

* Results (Bricklaying Example)
    * Raised the bricks on a shelf and made other changes to reduce amount of time and number of movements used
     **Results: 300% increase !!!**

##### Henry Fayol - Management (Administrative Science)

* Administrative science
    * More systematic principles to train leaders
    * He saw a lack of available management theory in his day (management didn't really exist)
    * He wanted to start a discussion
    * He wrote a book

* Management Activites
    * Planning - look ahead , plan
    * Organization - arrange people / tasks
    * Command - oversee, lead
    * Coordinate - harmonize and facilitate
    * Control - ensure compliance (accounting, finance, technical stuff)

At the time these thought were ground breaking

#### Common elements

* Hierarchy
* Division of labour
* Standardized approach
* Centralization of Authority
* Separate personal and work life
* Best people for the job
* Pay people fairly (more money to the best people)

**These three figures are the founding father of classical management theory**

Everything after is a reaction of some sort to these ideas

A lot of these things are still in use in factories, farming, fast food. So it is still relavent, in some industies it is even more common than it was before.

### Human Relations View

* Hawthorne Studies
    * Western Electric Company
    * Goal - determine optimal levels of lighting, temp and pace of work

    * Created experimental group and control groups
    * Altered conditions in experimental Groups
     And they saw substantial improvements!
     But they also saw substantial improvements when conditions were reverted

     **What's going on?**

     * It's not about the way jobs are structured , what the environment is like

     * It was about the fact that an improvement was trying to be made

     Psychological and social processes matter. The way workers preformed is relational, social.

* Calls attention to certain dysfunctional aspects of the classical view
    * Strict specialization conflicts with human needs for growth and achievement. Employees lose sight of the value of their work
    * Centralization fails to draw from lower level employees
    * Strict impersonal rules can lead to minimal performance regardless of capability

* Avocation for more people-oriented management
* Tension between the two Views

### Contingency Approach to Management

**THERE IS NO ONE BEST WAY**

ie. IT DEPENDS !!!!

* An appropriate management style depends on the demands of the situation

* Thinking about individual moderators
* Think about group/organizational moderators
* Think about environmental moderators

## Lecture 2

### What is personality ?

* While nature is important ... so too is nurture !

A set of Psychological characteristics influences the way they feel think behave

* You aren't defined by just one trait it is very much a set of traits
* People have a variety of personality characteristics / set of traits

### Why do we care?

Personality affects...

* Job attitudes (perceive / evaluate the workplace)
    * peoples dispositions related to how satisfied with their job(it didn't matter what job they had, their satisfaction stayed the same)
* Employee Moods
    * influence emotions that are experiences and expressed on the job
* Leadership (emergence and effectiveness)
    * who becomes a leader (leader emergence) ie. extroversion
    * How effectiveness ie. openness
* Workplace stress
    * the amount of stress you feel (because of the way your personality makes you see the world)
    * depending on your personality you may be more or less susceptible to stress
* Personnel selection / employee 'fit'
* Performance eg. sales, volume, profits, supervisor ratings, team
```
Performance = the extent to which an organizational member contributes to achieving the objectives of the team/organization
its not just about how much money a sale person can sell etc.
```
Does that beg the question ...
if its all about personality what can organizations do?
If people are you they are what can you do?

Of course not, there are things you can do regardless of personality

However that was the way people way things for the longest time

### Dispositionalism

* Focus on individual disposition personality
* Individuals are predisposed to behave in certain ways

### Situationalism

* Focus on contextual factors
* Environment etc.
* Organizations control how employees behave

### Interactionism

* Focus on the role and dispositions and situations
* We must know something about an individuals personality and the work setting
* However they both dont have the same weight ...

### Situation strength theory

* The impact of personality on behavior depends on the situation

* Strong situation () -- high degree
* Weak situation (not many rules, guidelines, expected behaviours) - low degree

Personality is most influential in weak situations ! Because their personality will shine through
In strong situations they are restrained, and so is their behaviour

How could organizations use this information?

* Strong situations
    * help keep employees in check
    * Help guide employees in task completion
    However
    * Can fosted dull / de-motivating environments
    * Can supress Creativity, problem-solving

They can use the information in job design.

* Creative jobs -> Weak situation
* Production line -> Strong situation

Organizations need to find the balance when designing their jobs

Situation strength is on a continuum. Its not necessarily one or the other
eg:
```
Weak ------ Moderate ------ Strong
```

### Fit

* Person organization (P-O) fit
    * Compatibility / congruence between people and the organizations in which they work
* Attraction - Selection - Attrition (ASA)
    * People seek out organizations that fit them (Attraction)
        * People high on extroversion would work well in an team environment
    * Organizations select individuals that have qualities that fit with their job/job environment (section)
    * When people don't like the environment leave (attrition)

Think about your fit to an orginization.

#### Personality testing

* Over 2500 personality tests
* 70% of companies are giving these assessments to employees

Implications of using these test in hiring people
    * Test legitimacy (some tests haven't been Scientifically proven)
        * kingdomality test
        * bird test
        * colour test
    * Social Desirability, Impression Management and Faking
        * Trying to craft an image that isn't inline with reality
    * The Multi-Dimensionality of Personality
        * What aren't we assessing that might be important
        * combinations of different levels of traits
    * Appropriateness of leaner selection models

```
Linear Effect:

The more x they have the better they will be at y

Curvilinear Effect:

ie. someone who never agrees with customers won't be good.
    someone who agrees with the customer  also won't be good
````
    * Ethical Implications
        * language level etc.

### Myers-Briggs Type Indicator  (MBTI)

* The most widly used test
* Used as a recruitment tool, career Planning
* Classifies people into personality categories

Extroverted vs. Introverted  (E or I)
Sensing vs. Intuitive (S or N)
Thinking vs. Feeling (T or F)
Judging vs. Perceiving  (J or P)

Used by many top Fortune 100 companies

* While it is the most widely used.. there is little empirical evidence supporting it!
    * Forces people into one type or another
    * Peoples personalities aren't binary
        * you are either Introverted or Extroverted
    * Lacks consistency
        * People will score different week by week
    * Doesn't consider situations
    * Problems with interpretability
    * Weak relationship to many job outcomes
        * its not predicting behavior how it should

So why are we talking about it?

* Its the most popular test
* It can still be useful... its just not the end all be all of everything

What should orginizations be using?

### The big 5

Premise: Personality can be efficiently describe with 5 trait dimensions

* Each facet relatively independent **each resides along a continuum** (one can display more or less of a trait)
* reproduced across cultures and language
* Research evidence points to heredity and stability

#### Introversion / Extraversion

Captures our comfort level with relationships
The extent to which a  person is out going versus shy
Refers to our preferred level of stimulation

* Sociable, talkative, outgoing, energized by busy environments
* Shy, withdrawn, overwhelmed by excessive sensory input

My Score: 1.375           (Dimension 1)
The higher the more extroverted

#### Emotional Sability / Neuroticism

Captures a person's ability withstand stress
The degree to which a person has emotional control

* Emotionally stable : high self-confidence

My Score: 2.25

#### Agreeableness/ Tough mindedness

Captures the propensity to defer to others
The degree to which a person is friendly and approachalbe

* Agreeable: Cooperative, warm , trusting, forgiving, gullible  
* Tough- minded: cold, disagreeable , antagonistic, arrogant
My Score: 3.625

#### Conscientiousness

Captures reliability
The degree to which a person is responsible and achievement oriented

* high: responsible, organized,
* low: disorganized, unresponsive
My Score: 3.125

#### Openness to Experience

Captures range of interest and fascination with novelty
The degree to which a person thinks flexibility and is receptive to new ideas

High: Creative , curious , artistically sensitive
Low: Conventional, comfort in the familiar
My Score: 3.125


### The big 5 at work

* Job performance
    * Individuals who are dependable, reliable, careful, thorough, able to plan, organized, hard working, persistent, and achievement oriented
    * Conscientiousness is strongly and positively related to individual performance
    * Conscientiousness is strongly and positively related to organizational performance
    ... but there are exceptions!!
    Too much of a good thing isn't a good think

    * In creative jobs Conscientiousness may not be good, impedance
    * Tasks involving change (they don't adapt well to change) - creates discomfort / do not like compromised ability to excel

    * Agreeable people..
        * first choice as partners
        * are more well liked
        * do better in interpersonally oriented jobs
        * work well on teams
        * are more rule abiding
        * engage in more OCB
        ...but
        * lower levels of career success
            * they don't fight for themselves

* Satisfaction
    * Emotionaly stability
    * Extraverts experience more positive emotions on the job and more freely express these feelings

* Stress
    * Neuroticism linked to lower levels of psychological well-being /difficulty facing challenging workplace experiences

* Leadership
    * Extraversion is a strong predictor of leader emergence
        * also if you will do well as a leader
        * comfortable with change
        * comfortable with thinking outside the box
    * openness is a strong predictor of leader effectiveness


### Other personality traits to Consider

* Locus of Control
* Self-esteem
* self - monitoring  

#### Marshmallow test

The strategies the kids used to fight the temptation to eat the marshmallow

#### Delay of Gratification

* The ability to reject immediate, smaller rewards in favour of delayed larger rewards
    * Marshmallow test
    * Low delayers more likely to have behavioural problems and preform poorly at school
    * Low delayers have difficulty with interpersonal relationships; stressful situations

    Replicated results longitudinally
    (ie. long-term effects)

    * High self control in childhood
        * Grow into adults with better health, mentally and physically, better saving etc.

    Strategic allocation of attention

    Within organizations "High delayers" are
    * more committed
    * more satisfied
    * less likely to turnover
    * better in organizational decision-making tasks

## 2.5: Perception & Attributions: Process

Human being aren't the most accurate perceivers ...

### What is perception?

    * The process of interpreting the messages of our sense to provide order and meaning to the environment
    * how to make sense of the world
    * however our perceptions can be off the mark, (we all see things in unique ways)
    * Perception is important because it affects how we behave.

    At work we are constantly fostering perception IN others...
    ... and OF others

    Managers form perceptions of people based on their workspace.
    i.e unorganized desk = lazy
    Which can then affect how their boss treats them, assignments, promotions etc.

    * How are our perceptions affecting our behaviour, how do others perceive us?
    * How does this affect our performance ?

### Components of Perception

#### The Perceiver
    * Experience / Expectations (the way you perceive people is affected by our personal experiences [which can differ])
        * Once a person expects to see something he/she typically will
        * met expectations feel good (we want to be right)
    * Motivational State/ Needs
        * We are motivated to come up with an explanation
        * We don't want to feel like we deserve this treatment
        * We are motivated to determine that the cause is outside of ourselves, so we don't damage our self esteem
    * Emotional State
        * People who are angry typically mispercieve others, (reading into a situation something that isn't their, overreacting)
    * Personality
        * Low levels of emotional stability might make you perceive  things around yourself negatively
        * etc.

#### The target

    * Physical
        * loud - extraverted
        * pretty - dumb
    * Behavioural
    * Relation to surroundings
        * people are rated more attractive in groups (cheerleader affect [how i met your mother])
        * we see things relative to their environment
        * we see groups as having similar traits (race etc..)
    * Ambiguity
        * We want to understand
    * Proximity
        * The closer the target is to you
        * the more info you can collect
        * both physical and emotional proximity

#### The Context

    * The context
    * Venue
    * Temperature
        * ie. wearing jeans around town - normal
        * might seem weird if you are in a board room with people all wearing suits

### Attribution Theory

When we observe people we try to explain their behaviour.
Can we blame them for what they are doing

* Dispositional attributions: Some characteristic unique to the person is responsible for their behaviour (ie. intelligence, laziness)
    * ie. person partied and stayed up late so they were late
* Situational attributions: the external situation/ environment is responsible for their behaviour (ie. poor advice , lack of resources)
    * ie. person was late because they were in a car accident

Can we blame people for their performance in jobs (disposition vs situational )

* Distinctiveness
    * Is the same behaviour displayed in different situations? (ie. is behaviour unusual for the target?)

* Consensus
    * Do others facing that situation behave the same way? (ie. would targets behaviour be unusual for others)
        * ie. everyone takes the same route to work but only the one person was late..

* Consistency
    * Does the target continue to display this same behaviour, in the same situation over time?

### Bias in Attribution

#### Fundamental Attribution Error

* The tendency to overemphasize dispositional explanations for the behaviour others
    * we often discount the strong effects that social/ job roles can have on others behaviour
    * we fail to realize that observed behaviour is distinctive to a particular situation
        * hyper aggressive lawyer may volunteer at a soup kitchen on the weekend

#### Self-Serving Bias

* The tendency for people to take credit and responsibility for their own successes and to deny credit and responsibility for failure
    * We are aware of the constraints forces in the environment that impacted us
    * we recognize our private thoughts, feelings, and intentions
        * i care about me work, other people don't know that so we i show up late they assume i don't care

### Perceptual Errors
Job candidates with facial piercings were perceived inaccurately due to perceptual errors

* Pierced individuals seen as :
    * more extroverted, less agreeable, less conscientious, less competent, less sociable, and not as trustworthy

    These finding came from both Student Raters... and Working Adults

#### Stereotyping:
The tendency to generalize about people in a social category and ignore variation among them

#### Selective perception/Halo Effect
Drawing a general impression of an individual base on a single characteristic (eg. appearance, likeability)
    * How a candidate looks impacts their rating

#### Contrast Effect
When the ratings of one person affect the ratings of another
    * See guy without piercings (so good), see guy with piercings (wow this guy isn't like the other guy, he sucks)

#### Primacy Effects
The tendency for a perceiver to rely on early cues and first impressions, when making judgments

Perceive "lack of fit with the position"

RESULT: not getting hired (pierced guy)
