COMP 2404
==========

## Lecture 1

### Instructors main goal
Your success as a software professional beyond this course, to graduation, and into your future

### Professional success requires
- Knowing how to produce **quality work**

- A professional attitude

### About the course

- We will focus on OO design
Independent of syntax; its more about design

- C++ language
Widely used in the industry, including game dev
A bit quirky

### Why is software engineering important
- It's not enough "just" to get a program working
- Has to be readable, because other people **WILL** work on it
- Easy to modify (isn't impossible to add new features)
- Easy to adapt to new platforms and applies

- Very few professional devs write code for **end users**

- Most users of your code will be other devs

### Course topics

- Basics of C++ devs
linux programming environment, conventions etc

- Basics of C++ classes
simple classes, constructors, destructors
memory management, pointers

- Basics of OO Design

- Essential OO techniques
encapsulation
inheritance
design patterns
**polymorphism**
overloading
templates
exception handling

- C++ library
STL files and streams, C++11 features

### Learning objectives

- OO Design
how to organize your data and logic
data abstraction and encapsulation

- implementation

- this is not a full software engineering Course
**That will be COMP3004**

### Programming environment

- We will use a virtual machine for this Course
use of the VM is mandatory for the assignments and tutorials

- You need to install VM

### Course page
Course notes
Coding examples

- Midterm and final exam cover **everything**
in class stuff, coding examples etc.

### Mark breakdown

Assignments (4) 20%
Tutorials (10) 10%
Midterm 25%
Final exam 45%

### Midterm

Mostly 'programming question'
Some multiple choice

### Tutorials

Bring paper and pencil for UML diagram

### Vitual machine

The virtual machine we use is on culearn


### Office hours

Instructor office hours & TA office hours

### Workshops

There will be 2 sessions for the assignments

## Section 1 - Basics of C++ Development

### Linux platform

* Unix family of operating systems

Open source and modular

* "root" or super-user can do **anything**
Can be extremely dangerous

* Unix family of OSs include
- Linux
- Solaris
- BSD
- HP-UX
- Mac OS X

### Shells

* What is a shell
 Program direct access to OS
 Allows users to run programs

* Major unix Shells
Bourne Shell (sh)
Bourne Again shell (bash)
c Shell

### Commands

* pwd (present working directory)
* ls (lists files in directory)
    ls -l gives you the long listing of the files
* cd (change dir)
.. to go up one
* cp (copy command)
* rm (remove)
* cat (looking at a 1 page file)
* more (multi pages)
* man (manual)
* You can use wildcards to filter (asterix)
* ! x (bang command x, repeats xth command)

* Interesting feature of shells: pipelining for I/O redirection
Connects a programs standard input or output to a file
**NOT** the same as file I/O

* Useful pipelining symbols
''< redirects a program's standard input from a specified files
''> redirects a program's standard output to a specified file

### Tools

* Text editor
* GNU C++ compiler: g++ (C++98)

* Many options
-o specifies name for output file
-c creates object  code

* Code must be compiled on the same platform it was coded in

### Program building

source -> (compiler -> linker)object code -> (executable)machine code -> user

* What is a program executable
A file that contains machine code instructions
OS and CPU **DEPENDENT**

* Characteristics of an executable
Consists of code from multiple source files

* Transforming C++ code into an executable

Compilation:
* Transforms C++ code to object code
    Input: souces
    Output: object code files

* Linker
    Output: executable

* Using Makefiles
Easy way to compile and link multiple files
