COMP 2404 - Introduction to Software Engineering
==========

## Lecture 1

### Instructors main goal
Your success as a software professional beyond this course, to graduation, and into your future

### Professional success requires
- Knowing how to produce **quality work**

- A professional attitude

### About the course

- We will focus on OO design
Independent of syntax; its more about design

- C++ language
Widely used in the industry, including game dev
A bit quirky

### Why is software engineering important
- It's not enough "just" to get a program working
- Has to be readable, because other people **WILL** work on it
- Easy to modify (isn't impossible to add new features)
- Easy to adapt to new platforms and applies

- Very few professional devs write code for **end users**

- Most users of your code will be other devs

### Course topics

- Basics of C++ devs
linux programming environment, conventions etc

- Basics of C++ classes
simple classes, constructors, destructors
memory management, pointers

- Basics of OO Design

- Essential OO techniques
encapsulation
inheritance
design patterns
**polymorphism**
overloading
templates
exception handling

- C++ library
STL files and streams, C++11 features

### Learning objectives

- OO Design
how to organize your data and logic
data abstraction and encapsulation

- implementation

- this is not a full software engineering Course
**That will be COMP3004**

### Programming environment

- We will use a virtual machine for this Course
use of the VM is mandatory for the assignments and tutorials

- You need to install VM

### Course page
Course notes
Coding examples

- Midterm and final exam cover **everything**
in class stuff, coding examples etc.

### Mark breakdown

Assignments (4) 20%
Tutorials (10) 10%
Midterm 25%
Final exam 45%

### Midterm

Mostly 'programming question'
Some multiple choice

### Tutorials

Bring paper and pencil for UML diagram

### Vitual machine

The virtual machine we use is on culearn


### Office hours

Instructor office hours & TA office hours

### Workshops

There will be 2 sessions for the assignments

## Section 1 - Basics of C++ Development

### Linux platform

* Unix family of operating systems

Open source and modular

* "root" or super-user can do **anything**
Can be extremely dangerous

* Unix family of OSs include
- Linux
- Solaris
- BSD
- HP-UX
- Mac OS X

### Shells

* What is a shell
 Program direct access to OS
 Allows users to run programs

* Major unix Shells
Bourne Shell (sh)
Bourne Again shell (bash)
c Shell

### Commands

* pwd (present working directory)
* ls (lists files in directory)
    ls -l gives you the long listing of the files
* cd (change dir)
.. to go up one
* cp (copy command)
* rm (remove)
* cat (looking at a 1 page file)
* more (multi pages)
* man (manual)
* You can use wildcards to filter (asterix)
* ! x (bang command x, repeats xth command)

* Interesting feature of shells: pipelining for I/O redirection
Connects a programs standard input or output to a file
**NOT** the same as file I/O

* Useful pipelining symbols
''< redirects a program's standard input from a specified files
''> redirects a program's standard output to a specified file

### Tools

* Text editor
* GNU C++ compiler: g++ (C++98)

* Many options
-o specifies name for output file
-c creates object  code

* Code must be compiled on the same platform it was coded in

### Program building

source -> (compiler -> linker)object code -> (executable)machine code -> user

* What is a program executable
A file that contains machine code instructions
OS and CPU **DEPENDENT**

* Characteristics of an executable
Consists of code from multiple source files

* Transforming C++ code into an executable

Compilation:
* Transforms C++ code to object code
    Input: souces
    Output: object code files

* Linker
    Output: executable

* Using Makefiles
Easy way to compile and link multiple files

## Lecture 2

### Basic Language Features

* Overview
* Terminology
* Operators
* Control and data structures
* Variables and data types
* Standard I/O streams
* Functions
* References

#### Overview

* polymorphism
* generic programming using templates
* operator overloading
* multiple inheritance
* exception handling

Allows calls to low-level C functions

#### Terminology

* Expression
    * seuence of operations that resolve to a single value
    * ex
        ```
        a + b -3 * c
        d * pow (g,a)
        ```    
* Statement
    * expression terminated by a semi-colon
    * ex
        ```
        tmpValue = a+b -3 * c;
        ```
    * Statements also resolve to a single value
        * Value may be void
* Block
    * Sequence of statements between a pair of matching braces
    * examples:
        Functions
        Loops, if-statements
        free floating blocks!

* Scope
    * the part of the program where a  variable can be used
* Block scope
    * local variables
* Global scope (also called files scope)
    * global variables
    * Industrial quality software **never** uses global variables

#### Operators

* arithmetic
* relational
* logical
* bitwise
* assignment
* conditional
    ```
    (y==x ? "equal" : "not equal")
    condition ? "true" : "false"
    ```

* Characteristics of operators
    * Arity
        * Number of operands
        * Operators can be unary, binary or ternary
    * Precedence
        * order in which operators execute
        * BEDMAS
    * Associativity
        * order in which operators of the same precedence execute
        * associativity can be left to right , or right to left

#### Control and Data Structures
* Control structues
    * conditional
    * selective
    * iterative
    * jump

* Data Structures
    * C-style structs (will not be using structs in this course) **public - BAD**
    * Classes **private - GOOD**

#### Variables and Data Types

* Characteristics of variables
    * name
    * value
    * data type
    * location in memory
    Pointers are just variables

* Data types
    * Primitive (built in)
    * Classes

#### Standard I/O Streams

* cout
    * ostream object used to std output
* cin
    * input
* cerr
    * error

''<< - stream insertion operator (used for output)"
''>> - stream extraction operator''

#### Functions
* Global functions
    * defined outside of any block
    * Available to all functions and classes in the program
    * eg. main()
* Member functions
    * defines within a class - 'method'
    * may be accessed on an object of that class
    * *static* member function can also be accessed out side that class

* Important terminology
    * function declaration
        * function prototype
    * function implementation
        * the code between the braces
* Member functions
    * declaration and implementation are stored in different files

#### Function design

* Correctly designed
    * take in data, do something, return result
        * return in two ways, return value or using parameters
    * are single-purpose
        * do one thing only
    * encapsulate (hide) their functionality
        * other programmers know what function does, not how it does it
    * should be reusable
        * in the same program, or in other programs
* Return values
    * often used to indicate success or failure (void)
    * used to return simple results from very simple functions
        * mostly "getter" functions
    * normally, results are returned using an output parameter (nothing to do with I/O)
        * this allows multiple values to be returned to calling function
        * more on this coming up...
* Parameters
    * pass by value (function works on local copy - changes are gone)
    * pass by reference (parameter is memory address)
        * use pointers or references
* **Every parameter has a role to play in the function**
    * input parameter
    * output parameter
    * input-output parameters

## Lecture 3

#### Function design (cont)

* input parameter
* output parameter
* input-output parameter

#### References

Example of int Reference
```
int&
```

You don't need to de-reference References because they aren't pointers.

* To pass parameters by reference:
    * We need to use a memory address as a variable
    * best way to do this is with *pointers*
    * alternative to pointers: *references*
* What is a reference not?
    * **not a variable** doesn't occupy memory
    * must be assigned a value on declaration
    * its value can never change
* What what is it?
    * **A binding** or an alias, for an existing variable
    * bound to another variable
    * creates a bond for the duration of the program
    * There is only one location in memory for both of them
    * References will be mostly used for passing parameters

Reference
 ```
 int n1, n2;
 int& r2 = n2;
 ```

### Programming Conventions

#### Naming Conventions

Helps others understand your code quickly

* Constants
    * names are all uppercase
    * you can use _ to separate multiple words
* Variables
    * names begin with lowercase
    * compound names use camel-case or underscore style
    * names must be descriptive without being **overly long**
        * use scope as context (ie. in student class, don't write studentId just write id)
    * single letters can be used as temporary variables
* Data types
    * names begin with uppercase letter
        * example : Student class
* Functions begin with lowercase
    * compound names use camel-case

#### Indentation
    * white space
    * why does it matter
        * promotes readability
    * Terminology
        * block
        * nested block
    * Indentation rules:
        * all statements within a block must be indented identically
        * all blocks at the same nesting level must have their statements indented identically to each other
        * there are three acceptable styles of brace indentation
        ```
        while(){
            ...
        }
        while()
        {
            ...
        }
        while()
        {
        ...
        }
        ```
        * do not mix styles! be consistent
        * How much?
            * Just be consistent
#### Commenting

* Block of comments in the file containing main
* Specifies:
    * purpose of program
    * usage
    * author(s)
    * revisions
* Each class
    * block of comments before the class
* specifies
    * purpose
    * complex or critical members
* don't put inline comments everywhere
    * summary of algorithm used
    * ranges of variables

### Basics of C++ Classes

* Class definition
* Constructors and Destructors
* Memory management

#### Class definition

#### Class members

* A class definition includes:
    * A class name
    * class members
        * data members
        * member functions
    * access specifiers
        * public, protected, private
    * default access specifier is private

#### Access Specifiers

* Data members aren't declared as public
    * either private or protected
* Industrial grade software is typically huge
    * millions of lines of code
    * protect your runtime objects from bad code
* The philosophy:
    * to protect the content of your classes, you must restrict access
        * principle of least privilege
* Class definition specifies access level for:  
    * each data member
* Public
    * visible to all objects and global functions
* Protected
    * by sub-classes
* Private
    * not visible to objects of other class types
    * objects of the same class can access private members

#### Member function implementation
* The code of a function
* for very small programs
    * Function implementation can be inside class definition
    * gets messy quickly
* For all others
    * function implementation in separate source file
* So where does your code go?
    * header file
        * class def
        * function prototype
    * source file
        * implementation (the actual code)
        * static data member initialization
